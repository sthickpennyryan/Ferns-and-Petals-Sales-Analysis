Provisional Checks:

Customer Table:
    No errors across all columns
     Customer_ID, Name, Contact, Email, Gender and Address all unique distinct which is ideal
      -- Note: Name has the potential to have duplicates if the rows span long enough as names can duplicate
      City has 86 distinct and 73 unique - many customers can be in the same city so this is fine.


Orders Table:
  No errors across the columns
  Order ID, Customer_ID -- distinct and unique which is good no duplicates
  Product_ID, Quantity, Order_Date, Otder_Time, Delivery_Date, Delivery_Time, Location - no errors many distinct/unique but everything seems fine

Products Table:
  Product_ID, Price, Description - all unique and distinct
  Product_Name is 68 distinct and 66 unique --- this should be all unique - query/change
  Category - 7 distinct 0 unique so 7 categories used over multiple products - this is fine
  Occasion - 7 distinct 0 unique so 7 categories used over multiple - this is fine

--- Common links: Customer_ID links customer table and Orders Table
Product_ID links products Table and Orders Table
